# Quadratic Equations Solver

That code make magic happen. There is just one function here, which get 3 variables (a,b,c) for the purposes of solving quadratic 
equation like: <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ax^{2}&plus;bx&plus;c=0" title="ax^{2}+bx+c=0" />
And the answer is two roots for norma case, and 1 or 0 for the innormal cases (negative discriminant).

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
