# Quadratic Equations Solver

That code make magic happen. There is just one function here, which get 3 variables (a,b,c) for the purposes of solving quadratic 
equation like: a^2x+bx+c=0

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
